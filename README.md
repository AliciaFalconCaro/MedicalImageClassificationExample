# This is an example of basic medical image classification. The purpose is to compare traditional techniques with DL techniques.


The first Jupyter notebook classifies the data using a linear support vector machine (SVM) and a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) with 5 neighbors.

The second Jupyter notebook uses a CNN and no preprocessing (except normalization) for the classification task.

For this mini-project, we will use the public dataset available here: [Skin Cancer ISIC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic/data).

The dataset is already separated in two folders: train and test. It contains multiple images from different skin cancers. In total, there are 6 classes of cancer in the dataset.
